### Note
1, In Appendix 10 Debugging Print section, there is a typo.

Original: `Workspace/> cargo -F test-user,debug -- -append args-none`
Fixed: `Workspace/> cargo run -F test-user,debug -- -append args-none`

2, Some of the dependencies in the enviornment need to be depreciated for the project to compile.
